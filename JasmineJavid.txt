Hello World!
My name is Jasmine Javid, and I'm a a new part-time FSW Lambda student.
I really don't have the luxury of having free time, but when I do come across 
a bit of free time I like to read. Let me rephrase... I LOVE to read!
I typically read novels written by POC, however I've switched gears a bit and I'm dabbling in some non-fiction reads that pertain to coding!
